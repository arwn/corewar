ASM:
  Missing close quote comment/name
  Hardcode test everything

COREWAR:
  Test
  Seg fault with 4 players in GUI
    -- `./corewar Gagnant.cor Gagnant.cor Gagnant.cor Gagnant.cor`
    breaks around cycle 1500
    has no output after introducing players
  Fix fork/lfork -- process calling fork and sometimes adjacent processes
                    incorrectly set instruction_time after forking
  helltrain1 -- issues related to fork on cycle 2745
  Fix live -- CYCLE_TO_DIE (tentatively fixed, need to verify more)

DONE:
  ASM:
    Fix names
    Fix labels with names conflicting with types
    Separator char with nothing after it
  COREWAR:
    Fix zjmp -- negative offset
    Fix unreadable player PC colors.  More contrast
    Check invalid header
    Load champions eqidistant from each other
    No winner output with disabled gui
    -- `./corewar -r Gagnant.cor Gagnant.cor Gagnant.cor Gagnant.cor`
      WONTFIX:
      Error check too small champ
