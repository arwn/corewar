      -- `./corewar -r -v31 -d2810 Gagnant.cor`
    Fix fork/lfork -- process calling fork and sometimes adjacent processes
      incorrectly set instruction_time after forking
    helltrain1 -- issues related to fork on cycle 2745
    Fix zjmp -- negative offset
    Fix unreadable player PC colors.  More contrast
    Check invalid header
    Load champions eqidistant from each other
